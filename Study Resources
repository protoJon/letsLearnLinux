Thank you for viewing our documentation. We will embark on a journey to develop a linux distrobution from the kernel onward. This will be an arduous quest and may take a considerable sum of time- but through the process we will become intimately familiar with the inner workings of our systems. No doubt there will be bumps in the road when we arrive at gaps of knowledge. The objective of this page is to be a roadmap where we can track our progress and cite our resources.

Where should I begin?
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linux-linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-0 ~Supremely~ valuable resource. Offered for FREE. Supported by the Free Linux Foundation and endorsed by the Linus Torvald himself. This course is an excellent place to begin understanding Linux, or a great refresher.

http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/ - overview of the Linux filesystem standard.





--FS BASICS: Linux treats just about everything as file-- 
Typical Linux distrobutions follow the unified filesystem set forth by the FSSTND and will have the following directories:
/root - the superuser profile directory
/home - the user(s) directory (/home/$USER)
/bin  - Contains essential binaries for single user functions
/sbin - Contains binaries essential for admin-specific functions
/boot - Everything required for the boot process. (vmlinuz, initramfs, config, [...])
/dev  - Contains device files. 
/etc  - Contain system config files and scripts.
/lib  - Contains kernel modules, program dependencies, and the C programming directory.
/media- Typically reserved for CD, DVD, and USB drive
/mnt  - 
/initrd  - 
/usr/bin - Contains non essential commands

The FileSystem hierarchy standard grew out of historical standards from early verions of Unix systems, such as the Berkeley Software Distrobution.
