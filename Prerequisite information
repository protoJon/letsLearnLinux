--FS BASICS: Linux treats just about everything as file-- http://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/
Typical Linux distrobutions follow the unified filesystem set forth by the FSSTND and will have the following directories:
/root - the superuser profile directory
/home - the user(s) directory (/home/$USER)
/bin  - Contains essential binaries for single user functions
/sbin - Contains binaries essential for admin-specific functions
/boot - Everything required for the boot process. (vmlinuz, initramfs, config, [...])
/dev  - Contains device files. 
/etc  - Contain system config files and scripts.
/lib  - Contains kernel modules, program dependencies, and the C programming directory.
/media- Typically reserved for CD, DVD, and USB drive
/mnt  - 
/initrd  - 
/usr/bin - Contains non essential commands

The FileSystem hierarchy standard grew out of historical standards from early verions of Unix systems, such as the Berkeley Software Distrobution.
