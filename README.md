Why do I care to learn and contribute to this project?
(lpJ): Computing technologies are an integral part of every modern field of study. They make our lives easier and help us complete tasks quicker. They bring us together and shorten the distance between the known and unknown. To me Linux, and other open source projects, represent a philisophical choice and not a technical one. Freely sharing software, ideas, and progress with anyone who is interested brings about rapid and reliable success. Many hands makes for easy work, many eyes makes for easy debugging.
